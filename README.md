## Description

Refactored code to include alt tags for images to increase accesibility. Consolidated a couple sections of CSS as well as added an id to search engine optimization link, which is now functioning. Changed <div class="header"> to the semantic HTML <header>.

Here is a screen shot of the accesibility changes
